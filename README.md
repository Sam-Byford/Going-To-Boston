# Going-To-Boston

The first-year module 'Programming And Data Structures' required me to create the game "Going to Boston" in C# for our third assignment. 

Rules;

The concept of Going to Boston is not complicated. It needs three dice. Roll the three dice
and take the highest number from each roll. Each time you roll you lose a die. So the first
roll is going to be with three dice, the second with two, and the third with a single die.
Total up the three dice, the player with the highest value wins that round.

Requirements;

You should be able to choose between:
1) ‘Match play’: Players win a point each round. The first to 5 wins the game.
2) ‘Score play’: Players add up their total after each round. The player with the
highest score after 5 rounds wins the game. 

Extended edition;

Create a version of the game in which one player plays against the computer.
